# Francisâ€™ answer to the Paintshop Problem



### How to approach

One of the approaches to solving this problem is to retrieve all combinations from the space created by *2N of colors* and *M of customers*. The point is to efficiently find possible combinations __using given constraints__. 

Here I introduced a *trie*, where each depth of the trie indicates a customer and each node represents a preferred color batch of a customer. When construction of a trie, I sorted it in advance in order to efficiently retrieve as follows:

* At each depth, sort the batches by *glossiness* and *color* (smaller index of color and glossy first)
* Sort customers by the size of batches each customer has (smaller size first)

Then, we can easily solve this using a recursive function (namely, with the help of call stack: the trie search is performed while winding and unwinding of the stack). An answer firstly satisfying constraints of the problem will be the answer we are looking for.

***Note***: A drawback of this solution is that it uses call stack. (But we can get a cleaner and simpler code) Surely, an overflowing stack should not happen. However, the limits given in the problem for both small dataset and large dataset are enough to cover with this solution, in general. However, the Python interpreter limits the depths of recursion to avoid infinite recursions (by default `1000`). The default value is sufficient, but I conservatively adjusted this a bit in my code.



### How to run

```bash
# Python 3.6 or later is recommended
# INPUT_FILE in problem-defined format
$ python3 answer.py INPUT_FILE

# self-prepared case test
$ python3 test.py -v
```
